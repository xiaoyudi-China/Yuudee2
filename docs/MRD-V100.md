# Market Requirements Document


## 1.About of this document
  This document mainly explains the market demand, user analysis and functional analysis of Yuudee2 products.
### 1.1 Documentation purposes
  This document summarizes the needs of the market and users, organizes the function Settings, and provides guidance for the prototype design of Yuudee2.
## 2. Target market analysis
### 2.1 Target market
   Mainly for children with autism in China, this population of autistic children should have simple language.（For example, he can say "apple", "xiao Ming", "eat", "eat apple" and other simple nouns, verbs or gerunds.）. It also applies to other children who have language barriers and need training.   
### 2.2 Market Size
   There are 250 million children under 12 years in China. Using 1% prevalence in 2014, it is estimated that there are 2.5 million children in Autism Spectrum. 
Among those children in the spectrum, around 20% have very light symptoms, who used to be diagnosed as Asperger Syndrome (AS) or high function autism (HFA). This group has generally normal language development. About 30% children have very severe symptoms, who could barely emerge some basic morpheme。 Yuudee 2 is not targeting either of these two group.

50% of the children are able to develop words or simple phrases, however have the challenge in getting to complex phrases or compound sentences. This group is the target users of Yuudee 2. 

Thus the target user base for Yuudee 2 is around 1.25M. (Yuudee could also help other children not in autism spectrum but fall in language development challenge ie. Dyslexia, however we do not have the data for the user base).

### 2.3 Feature of the market
   At present, most of the rehabilitation of autistic children in China is using the training of ABA as the main method in training institutions. The trainer will teach the child situational sentences by allowing the autistic child to mimic the way the teacher describes the static picture. This is not the best way to train since the dominant learning type for autistic children is visual learning. Traditional teaching is limited to desktop teaching tools, It is difficult to provide dynamic multi-sensory visualization training. General training is less efficient, and children with autism are chronically trained which is expensive. Yuudee2 is an automated training software, Children with autism can learn independently and are no longer dependent on teachers or parents. Moreover, it can show the scene pictures in a dynamic way, so that children can understand and learn sentence rules effectively. And the Yuudee2 are completely free.
### 2.4 Development tendency
Given the large population, the market potential for AAC is huge in China. And the target user base for Yuudee 2 is around 1.25M, Yuudee 2 expects to achieve 2000 users 6 months after its launch. And accumulate 100,000 users in 4 years.

## 3. Target user analysis
### 3.1 User analysis

Yuudee2's target users are autistic children, but because of the disorder characteristics of children with autism, it is difficult for them to search for learning and training products. Therefore, the users of Yuudee2 products are the parents of children with autism. Because autism is a lifelong developmental disorder, most children with autism struggle to live their lives, Therefore, it is the parents' greatest wish to be able to self-care. Young autistic children show that self-learning and self-management are rather weak, It takes parents and teachers to teach, which takes up a lot of parents' time and energy. Most families with autism children need at least one parent to leave their jobs and take care of their children full-time And most training institutions, because of the limited resources of teachers, need parents to attend classes with their children, In the classroom, the child's training effect depends on the teaching method and the level of the parents could help. And after years of training, most parents are exhausted. If there is an automated software that can appeal to autistic children to learn something autonomously and efficiently, it is something autistic parents crave. The use of modern artificial intelligent electronic devices can realize parents' wish. On the other hand, parents also worry about the impact of electronic products on their children's health and their dependence or inability to generalize.
### 3.2 Users personas
San Zhang  Female

Age：33

Occupation：full-time house wife（A former employee of the company, who has resigned in the past two years to take care of the children.）

Married, has one son who is four years old now. He was diagnosed with autism two years ago and began rehabilitation training. At present, the boy spends half-day at kindergarten, half-day at organization training. After two years of training, children can now express more than 50 commonly used items and can express some daily requirements using gerunds. The expressions are very brief, and they don't use modifiers. There are some sentences, but most sentences are chaotic. Delayed imitation is dominant, and pronoun is used incorrectly. When the mother is busy, she will give the child mobile phone to play, the child can play some simple games or listen to children's songs by themselves. Mother takes the child to the kindergarten every morning and then goes home to do the housework. Pick up the children at noon for lunch, then send them to the institution for training, and help to train the boy together in the afternoon, and learn the training methods. She goes back home at night, does the housework, and really hope that someone can help her take care of the child, and teach the child some knowledge. But in most case, no one is sharing, and the boy himself plays the mobile games again and again, which is not helpful for the children's language training. But she was so tired that she hardly had time to relax.
### 3.3 Usage scenario 

* scenario one：

In the group chat “Dami Xiaomi Fan”, There is a parent link saying that the Yuudee team has released the second edition of free software, which you can download. This Yuudee2 product allows children with autism to learn Chinese grammar and expression by themselves. It is a amazing application that don’t require teacher and parents to be around. After the parents see the link, with such a good software for free, they download to take a look first.

* scenario two：

Starting at Xingxingyu education institute, The children were graded by the teacher's detailed evaluation, and divided into different classes. For the students in the three classes which graded in the middle, the teacher recommended that parents download raindrop 2 software. Children go back home and let the children train their own Chinese grammar and sentence expression. Since it is the teacher's recommendation, it is free, parents are downloading, insisting on the child to use, and will feedback to the teacher timely. Suggestions for software use can be found in the Yuudee2 product communication group.
### 3.4 Users motivation summary
•	Parents with autism children want their children to learn independently;

•	Parents with autism children have more research on their children's education. Parents are very willing to try a free application that can help children；

•	The group of autistic families is very strong, and once the application was approved by one parent, it can be used rapidly in their community.

•	The training of autism requires a lot of long-term training. The teachers of the autism training institute also hope that there is some help that can guarantee a certain time of training to assist and strengthen the teaching effect. So they're going to promote good training software.

## 4. Competing goods analysis
### 4.1 Direct competitive analysis.
   In our global competitive product analysis, there are couple of similar products  i.e Rainbow sentence, but they are not offered in Chinese language, nor do they have a very specific data driven milestone approach. Yuudee 2 will be a pioneer AAC in the Chinese market for complex and structured sentence communication. Our data driven approach is also a pioneer work, if Yuudee 2 is successful in Chinese market, we could consider to deploy it in other language market.
   
In china, the acceptance of AAC market is still low, there is no specific AAC Chinese solution yet on complex and compound sentence building for students of Autism spectrum disorder.
### 4.2 Indirect competitive analysis.
  Most of the products for children with autism in China and abroad are cognitive training products based on the ABA training method. This kind of product design is relatively easy and mature, but the core symptoms of autism are communication and social disorder. Cognitive training is less likely to improve the core symptoms of autism. However, it is difficult to design and develop products that are directly aimed at the core state. Yuudee2 is a product that wants to try and use software equipment to train the communication of core symptoms of autism (mainly in terms of language communication).
