# Yuudee2 product proposal

## 1.Background

Social and communication deficits are the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Language is a crucial part of social communication and interaction. While neurotypical children acquire mother language syntax almost spontaneously during age 3-6 years (as A.N. Chomsky described as generative grammar), it was, however, one of the challenge logic for ASD children to acquire. The difficulties on language syntax are variable among children with ASD and can affect the symptoms of children with ASD. Language levels is an important indicator of prognosis and social functioning. Therefore, parents are very concerned about the language skills of their children and are eager to their improvements on language. Currently, many therapies target language skills and are shown to be effective at improving the language skills of children with ASD. In addition, with the fast development of mobile touchscreen devices, mobile touchscreen devices can provide vivid and visualizable learning opportunities for children with ASD. In 2014, we released an augmentative and alternative communication mobile App that was designed and developed for children with ASD, the first in Mainland China to our knowledge, named Yuudee (Chinese name: 小雨滴 (xiaoyudi)). Since then, Yuudee has been widely popularized among children with ASD and has won high affirmation and recognization of parents of children with ASD and trainer from autism intervention centers. Our research study showed that Yuudee training can improve the communication skills of minimally verbal children with ASD. In addition, some parents reported that their children could speak more functional words after a period of sustained Yuudee training. Yuudee only targeted ASD children with limited spoken language. When spoken language develops and is sufficient for ASD children to expressive basic communication needs in the daily life, Yuudee is not suitable for these children anymore. After ASD children develop beyond being minimally verbal, new problems on their language will occur. For example, sentence structure is incorrect, some component is omitted which makes sentences incomplete, wrong pronouns are used, and most sentences used by children are simple sentences. These problems make it difficult for children with ASD to effectively communicate with others. Therefore, we aim to develop Yuudee 2that target sentence structure. Yuudee 2 will provide training to help children with ASD to use sentences with right structure and complex sentences with more details to share their experiences in their life with others and make comments. When the language skills taught by Yuudee 2 are generalized to their daily life with the prompts provided by their caregivers, children’s social and communication skills can greatly improve. In addition, for ASD children who are about 6 years old but still have poor language skills, they should gradually prepare to enter primary school. Sentence making and writing essays are important learning parts in primary school which require children having good language syntax. Yuudee 2 provide training on language syntax and can help ASD children be more prepared to fluently accomplish the study tasks in primary school.

Therefore, those kids with a certain level of cognitive understanding abilities and are able to use gerundial phrase could be applied with an effective method(intelligent software system and multi-sensory interaction training help ASD children during sentence practice) which could construct the concept of sentence structure in children's mind. With a great amount of practice, ASD children will master syntax more quickly. By uploading personal activity photos to assist ASD children spontaneously express their experiences, thoughts, comments and other more complex forms of communication in their lives.

## 2.Vision of the product

To help the children with special need construct a sentence structure in the cognitive structure of the brain, enable their abilities to express themselves in sentences naturally in life. Let the children with autism who are backward in their mental development track catch up with the development milestones compare with other children as soon as possible.Let them communicate without obstacles.

## 3.Aim of the product

Helping children with autism span the language barrier from saying phrases to sentences, arouse children's ability to ask questions and ask for information, and the ability to answer questions and answers in a conversation. At the development milestones of the child's expression of ability, dialogue, and language structure, making progress to a level milestone(from Level 2: psychological age 1.5-2.5 years old - to LEVEL3: psychological age 2.5 to 4 years old), promotes the mental development of ASD children.

## 4.Product features, target users, main components

The product aims to help children with autism who are more than 3 years old, and have a fragmented language (e.g., "eat the apple", "go to the supermarket" and “play swing”) and other children who have difficulties in language and communication need to express complete sentences. Training from a sentence that contains a noun phrase or verb phrase in the simplest form to a complex sentence containing a noun phrase and a verb phrase. In the process, from the three dimensions set difficulty level, use sentences from extract's core ingredients combined with scene images in the form of interactive exercises, each level with containing about 50 or so sentence for training. In addition, we use two other dimensions of training to assist and generalize autistic children to better master each syntax.The first dimension is the visual aid setting: from the breakdown of the color of the sentence to the completion of the sentence combination to the fourth level which gradually withdraws the auxiliary, independently complete the sentence combination.The second dimension is generalization training, which allows children to generalize the same sentence meaning to different scenes through the transformation of the same level sentence pattern and the different scenes of the circumstances.Through the tracking function which monitoring  the effectiveness on children’s learning, and then through personalization features, add picture of life story that happens to the children themselves, assist children to express their life experiences, after practice (AAC), can make children express themselves with sentences and q&a form of interactive dialogue in a natural scene.

## 5. Theoretical basis of the product

Using color visual cues and multi-sensory teaching, the children with language disorders can learn to construct sentences using the correct grammar, and learn how to arrange the use and expression of the subject-verb and modifier in the sentence.

In a large number of literature and practice teaching, visual learning is the dominant learning channel of most ASD children, while color cues can provide effective auxiliary in reading and understanding language, and in many communication systems, have introduced color tips for users to construct the effective application of conceptual structure.The study also shows that children with dyslexia and autistic spectrum disorders can benefit from multi-sensory teaching strategies. By letting students operating drag and drop words or sentences on the screen and the rendered image matching approach provides students handheld construct sentence structure of experience, they can be spoken and written language to achieve integration effect, Yuudee2 uses these language learning methods of color and visual cues and adds a multi-sensory teaching strategy.

Based on VB language - MAPP structure development milestone of tests, it can be concluded that, in the second stage language structure of the development of children, through mastering the noun phrases and verb phrases adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, quantifier of modifiers such as adding sentences, can progress to the development of the third phase of the structure of a language level, help children making progress of the structure of language to reached a milestone.

## 8.User survey

- Study on the demand of ten target parents who are raising ASD children, and feedback from foreign products.

All ten parents whose children with autism reported problems in language expression: The typical specific expression of autistic children were found in 10 children's language expressions such as misnomer, the order of the sentence is reversed.It is difficult to express complete sentences for five of the typical ASD children. They can only make a sentence by fill-in-the-blanks. When parents remind the beginning of a sentence, the child can fill in the blanks, but cannot express the complete sentence by themselves. There are other three children with serious delays and imitation in language expression. By that means the children will answer the question by repeating the question itself. Making the conversation unmatched. The rest of the two children have no issue to express simply sentences, but it is difficult for them to accurately describe things and maintain a dialogue, and can not express themselves voluntarily. Yuudee2 is designed to address the language problems of autistic children in parental research.Through multi-sensory teaching and visual cues, children with autism can gradually learn to construct complete and informative sentences to describe things, and learn the characteristics of Chinese grammar construction then apply it into their expression freely in life.

- Three special teaching teachers demand research and teaching experience sharing and training content guidance

Studied the teachers of the Beijing star education institution, Miss Zheng Tiantian. Mr. Hou Yawei, who was a former teacher Beijing's colorful deer teaching institution, and Miss wang xiuqing, a teacher of the Beijing Xing xingyu education institution.

- Sharing of teaching experience: ABA

To teach a child a sentence in the form of a picture, first of all, to see if the child can understand some of the concepts, for example: who is this person? what is he doing? If the child could give answers, then we could teach the child to say the complete sentence by using visual hint or imitation. With a great amount of enhancing practice, after mastering in making simply sentences, add more elements in the sentence. For example, where, why, how?. After each step, we could practice those sentence at real-life conversation. Use the sentences structure that the child just learned. If the child meets any difficulties, an assistant might take photos during the learning process, and use those photos as a visual hint to cue the child and let he speak out what just happened. The sentence could grow from short to long and by adding more elements into the sentence gradually, the child could express himself with a longer sentence. In the end, the child would be able to describe his experience at kindergarten and be able to hold a conversation in daily life.

- Training guidance

In the daily training of children with autism, vocabulary, modifiers, sentence patterns were shared, and the training content of  Yuudee2 product design has it guidance and suggestions were given.

- W

(1)	The development team of Yuudee2 product lacks teachers with longitudinal experience of autistic teaching. We can only rely on the help of teachers at our partner institution.

(2)	Yuudee2 product development team lacks senior Chinese grammar experts, can only rely on their own self-learning and consult the corresponding experts.

- O

(1)	No domestic product competition pressure:
At present, there are few AAC products for children with autism in China, and there are few products for the language structure training of children with autism.

(2)	Reference of foreign competitive products: The reference of a few products abroad is provided for Yuudee2.

- T

(1)	Yuudee2 will become China's first AAC product aimed at language structure training for children with autism. Without reference to the previous products or feedback, it will be a great challenge to the product.

(2)	Although there are a few competing goods abroad, there is a large difference between English grammar and Chinese grammar, the need to redefine Chinese grammar is critical. Also, study the characteristics of ASD children grasping Chinese grammar structure were rare both in-depth research and resources.
